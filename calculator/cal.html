        <h1>Understanding Your Taxes</h1>
        <p>
            With great earnings come great responsibilities—like paying taxes! At <b>SpendWise</b>, we believe in 
            making tax information clear and simple for everyone. Here's a breakdown of how income tax works:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Less than ₹3 lakh?</b> Good news! You pay <b>zero</b> tax. Enjoy your hard-earned money!</li>
            <li><b>₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh?</b> A minimal <b>5%</b> tax applies. Consider it a small contribution to the nation!</li>
            <li><b>₹5 lakh to ₹6 lakh?</b> Still just <b>5%</b>. Smart financial planning can help reduce your taxable income!</li>
            <li><b>₹6 lakh to ₹9 lakh?</b> Now at <b>10%</b>, it’s time to optimize deductions and savings!</li>
            <li><b>₹9 lakh to ₹12 lakh?</b> A <b>15%</b> tax applies. Strategic investments can help lower your tax burden.</li>
            <li><b>₹12 lakh to ₹15 lakh?</b> With <b>20%</b> tax, it’s important to maximize exemptions.</li>
            <li><b>Above ₹15 lakh?</b> You’re in the <b>30%</b> bracket, but with smart planning, you can reduce taxable income efficiently.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>For your total income of ₹0, your total tax due is ₹0.</b></p>
